------------------------------------------------------------------

Optimal Batch Size: 1000
Maximum Throughput: 1207997.62 operations per second
Improvement over non-batched: 66.35x

Theoretical Maximum with Tendermint (10k tx/s limit): 10000000.00 operations per second

Analysis:
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Performance Scaling: As batch size increases, the operations per second
   increases dramatically, up to 66.35x with batch size 1000.
2. Optimal Batch Size: There appears to be a sweet spot around batch size
   1000 where performance is maximized. Beyond this, the overhead of
   processing very large batches may start to reduce efficiency.
3. Tendermint Limit: With Tendermint's theoretical limit of ~10,000
   transactions per second, using a batch size of 1000 could potentially
   process up to 10000000.00 operations per second.
4. Real-world Considerations: In a real blockchain network, factors like
   network latency, validator performance, and block size limits would
   affect these numbers. The actual optimal batch size might be different.

Recommendations:
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Start with a batch size between 50-200 in production environments.
2. Monitor performance and adjust batch size based on network conditions.
3. Consider implementing dynamic batch sizing based on network load.
4. For maximum throughput, consider using Protocol Buffers instead of JSON
   for transaction encoding (see examples/protobuf_migration.md).
5. Ensure your application can handle the atomicity implications of
   batched transactions (all operations succeed or fail together).
